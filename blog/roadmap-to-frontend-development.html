            <p>As of now, One of the most demanding jobs in the market is of front-end web developers. Before start learning the Front-end tools and technologies, there are several things that you need to understand.</p>

            <h2>Step #1</h2>
            <p>One of them is the Internet. Get the basics of how the internet works. What is HTTP? What is DNS and how the browsers work with different markup languages? What is web hosting and domain?</p>
            
            <h2>Step #2</h2>
            <p>After learning the very basics of internet things. Now you need to work on the mark language, I'm talking about the HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language). HTML is not a programming language. Its only a markup language meaning you can only write the blueprints of a web design. Learn the basics of HTML, get the know-how of Semantics tags of HTML. You need to understand the use of different HTML tags such as html, body, paragraph tags etc. In order to make it more understandable, you need to make forms, validations in html.</p>
            <p>Next is CSS. It stands for Cascading Stylesheet. CSS is basically used to stylize the HTML blueprint. Means, the CSS decides the width, height, color, shape etc. of a div or a block that is present in HTML code. CSS also handles all the layouts (floats, display, positioning, box-sizing, CSS grid, flex model) along with the properties of responsive designs with media queries.</p>
            
            <p>Last but not the least is JavaScript. It's a high level general purpose programming language that is used to give functionality to a web design. In order to learn JavaScript, you need to pay attention to the syntax and construct, learn the DOM manipulation, get the know-how of Fetch API/Ajax etc. In the end, you must opt to go for ES6 and modular JavaScript. Understand the concepts of hoisting, Event bubbling, Scope, Prototype, Shadow DOM, scripts etc.</p>
       
            <h2>Step #3</h2>
            <p>After learning the necessary tool that serve the basics of front-end web development, you need to learn the concepts of Version Control System. Version Control Systems or VC includes Git, Github, GitLab, ButBucket etc. let you save you current snapshop of project while it lets you retrive the past stored snapshots from the server to your pc. One of the most popular Version Control System is GitHub where you create you project repository, then push you project into it while you can commit any changes from time to time in it.</p>
